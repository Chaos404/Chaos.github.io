            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">In this case, you are the data analyst of Luxura, which is an e-commerce
                company focusing on selling luxury fashion products. The store exclusively sells
                several globally-famous brands, such as Adibi, Balena, and Celinna. These
                famous brands are partnering with Luxura to specifically sell and market their
                products to the Indonesian fashion market, because their market share has
                increased 38% combined in the last 3 years. The increasing market share is
                competitive between them, because they have similar price range & product
                types. These three brands do not have any partner store other than Luxura.
                Because of this exclusivity, Luxura has a mission to prioritize either Adibi,
                Balena, or Celina marketing. Luxura hasn't decided about which brand to focus
                on. Yet, based on partnership fee data, Adibi has paid 80 million US dollars to
                Luxura in February 2023, which was the highest fee ever paid to Luxura.
                Miss Sofia, your Head of Data, is someone who believes strongly in data.
                She will believe anything, if it has numbers & meanings. In this case, all the
                bosses in the company wanted to prioritize Adibi because it paid the hiahest fee
                to Luxura, but Miss Sofia believes we need to take a look at the purchase
                performance first. She wants to learn from past purchase data, which has been
                handed-over to vou. The data consists of purchase information and identitv of
                each user who has made a purchase to Luxura in the last quarter of 2022 (3
                months of data). Hence, Miss Sofia expects you to deliver insights on this
                matter before the companv makes a decision.
                To deliver the insights, first you need to understand the business
                problem and the data you have.

                <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Of the three partners, judging by the Qty the highest sales were Adibi, but the sales revenue was small. On the other hand, in Celinna Qty sales are low but sales revenue is high. This happened because Adibi Partners sold relatively cheap products, resulting in high purchases of Adibi products.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">In purchasing behavior, buyers who are single make more purchase transactions compared to those who are not single (divorced/separated/married/widowed). In my opinion, this happens because what is being sold is luxury fashion products, so the average buyer is still single and young. Apart from that, single status does not have much economic responsibility for the family.</p>

So it can be interpreted that the purchase value of Luxura partners (Adibi, Balena, Celinna) does not affect each other. But of the three business partners, Celinna has the highest purchase value, then Belina, and lastly Adibi.</p>
